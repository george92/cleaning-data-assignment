###this tidy data set contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject from the orgin dataset.

for example: 
In the first row, Grouping.1 is "LAYING" and Grouping.2 is 1. the value of tBodyAcc-mean()-X is 0.2761402. That means, the average of tBodyAcc-mean()-X that are subject 1 and "LAYING" is 0.2761402. So the values of each variables in the dataset should be understood in this way: the average value of that variables that are in both Group.1 and Group.2
